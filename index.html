			<p class="info"><i>Leaving Clouds</i> is a project by Understanding IM students Jana, Will and Luize. It represents the change in pollution from flights in the past year, including the significant decrease in March 2020 after many travel restrictions. We traced and collected the aircraft movement data from FlighRadar24 for the geographic area above the UAE. Then we used this data and visualized it in Processing using a map and a “pollution cloud” to represent each flight in the air at the moment. Our goal was to demonstrate the degree of the destructive impact our travel behavior and habits have on the environment. The fact that the air traffic is one of the highest pollutant and sources of CO2 emissions is well-known. However, it is easy to become desensitized towards hearing numbers such as that on a one way trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City (in Economy class) the total CO2 emissions per passenger are estimated to be 629,8 kg. What does this mean? Is having this piece of information in any way meaningful? What impact does it have on a local area? Isn't it more of a buzzword without much substance to it?</p>
